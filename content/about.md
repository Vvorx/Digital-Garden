# About me

My name is Igor, and I am a Computer Science student at the University of Huddersfield.

Here's a list of things I like:

- programming
- [reading](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/vvor?redirect=true)
- working out
- art
- travelling
- running

I see myself as a lifelong learner. The primary goal of this site is to document my progress on my goals while improving my ability to express myself.
