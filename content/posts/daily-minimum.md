If you find yourself struggling to start or make progress on the things you care about, it might be time to introduce a **daily minimum**.


#### What is a daily minimum?
A daily minimum is the smallest quantifiable amount that counts as completing an activity.


For example, let’s say you want to start reading more, so you set a daily goal of 30 minutes. At first, this seems achievable, but over time, 30 minutes can feel overwhelming. You might find it hard to start, begin skipping days, and eventually give up altogether.

A better approach is to set a **minimum** for instance, just 5 minutes a day. After those 5 minutes, you can choose to continue or stop. While you may not always read for 30 minutes, you’re far less likely to quit. Those consistent 5+ minute sessions add up over time, leading to much more progress than an ambitious goal thats hard to maintain.
