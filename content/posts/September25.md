# This months reading

### Maus

Maus is a graphic novel that tells the story of the Holocaust through the eyes of the author’s father, Vladek. The book is written as a frame tale, with the author often interviewing his father and getting him to recount his experiences during the war.

AMAZING BOOK! I really enjoyed seeing the war from the perspective of someone who actually lived through it. One thing I noticed is that the author’s father had a tendency to lie in the present, which makes you wonder if he might have embellished some of his experiences as well.
### Crucial Conversations

Another book I was quite disappointed with. Filled with a lot of bloat and repetition, don't bother.
### On Bullshit

*On Bullshit* is a essay by **Harry G. Frankfurt** that was first published in 1986 and later expanded into a short book in 2005 that's a philosophical exploration of the concept of "bullshit". 

This book wasn't very noteworthy for me apart from Frankfurt's argument that bullshitting is more harmful than lying, with liars at least acknowledging the truth while the bullshitters disregard it completely. 

If you need a short read to get an additional book in for your reading goals this is it :^) 

### The Climber

I debated including this for a few days as I wasn't sure whether or not to count manga towards my yearly reading goals.

The main reason was that I figured manga would artificially boost my page and book counts since it’s super easy to read a couple of volumes in a day. To fix the book count, I just added the first volume and called it a day (totally ignoring the page count since it doesn’t really matter)

The story follows a loner named Buntaro Mori, who discovers his love for climbing after being bullied into climbing his high school building, and eventually becomes a world-class climber aiming to conquer K2. I LOVED this manga the art, the plot, everything was amazing. The only thing that kind of disappointed me was the ending.
