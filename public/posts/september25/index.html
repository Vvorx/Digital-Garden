  Maus
  <a class="anchor" href="#maus">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Maus is a graphic novel that tells the story of the Holocaust through the eyes of the author’s father, Vladek. The book is written as a frame tale, with the author often interviewing his father and getting him to recount his experiences during the war.</p>
<p>AMAZING BOOK! I really enjoyed seeing the war from the perspective of someone who actually lived through it. One thing I noticed is that the author’s father had a tendency to lie in the present, which makes you wonder if he might have embellished some of his experiences as well.</p>

  Crucial Conversations

<p>Another book I was quite disappointed with. Filled with a lot of bloat and repetition, don&rsquo;t bother.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="on-bullshit">
  On Bullshit
  <a class="anchor" href="#on-bullshit">#</a>
</h3>
<p><em>On Bullshit</em> is a essay by <strong>Harry G. Frankfurt</strong> that was first published in 1986 and later expanded into a short book in 2005 that&rsquo;s a philosophical exploration of the concept of &ldquo;bullshit&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This book wasn&rsquo;t very noteworthy for me apart from Frankfurt&rsquo;s argument that bullshitting is more harmful than lying, with liars at least acknowledging the truth while the bullshitters disregard it completely.</p>
<p>If you need a short read to get an additional book in for your reading goals this is it :^)</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="the-climber">
  The Climber
  <a class="anchor" href="#the-climber">#</a>
</h3>
<p>I debated including this for a few days as I wasn&rsquo;t sure whether or not to count manga towards my yearly reading goals.</p>
<p>The main reason was that I figured manga would artificially boost my page and book counts since it’s super easy to read a couple of volumes in a day. To fix the book count, I just added the first volume and called it a day (totally ignoring the page count since it doesn’t really matter)</p>
<p>The story follows a loner named Buntaro Mori, who discovers his love for climbing after being bullied into climbing his high school building, and eventually becomes a world-class climber aiming to conquer K2. I LOVED this manga the art, the plot, everything was amazing. The only thing that kind of disappointed me was the ending.</p>
